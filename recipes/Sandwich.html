   <h3>The Backstory You Never Asked For</h3>
   <p> Growing up in the small town of Sandwich, Illinois, I remember sandwich cousine being an essential part of our lifestyle. 
       We ate nothing else but various sandwich dishes, so there was no choice but to get extremely creative with recipes.
       As a community, there is a common known practice called <em>"Bulls Hitting",</em> (I know, weird name, and I have no idea where it comes from!)
       for those days when creativity and innovation is lacking. <br>
       <p><strong>Bulls Hitting</strong> is the tradition of inviting your friends and family over for a lavish sandwich dinner, and making it up as you go.
    Really. You write random food items on a sheet with whatever measurements you deem appropriate, and wing it! You either end up with a horrible dish
and priceless memories from pranking your guests, or you make a great dish.
With that being said, here is one dish my sister and I came up with through this great tradition. If I had one piece of advice for you going into this, it would be to <em>trust the process.</em> 
You will think this recipe is ridiculous, but I promise it will rock your socks off!</p><br>

    <h3>What you'll need:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups sand, separated</li>
        <li>3 Small baking sheets</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Beach</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The prep time for this Sand-Sandwich is 2 minutes, but setting time will take 1 hour. Lets get started!</p>
    <ol>
        <li> Have all of your ingredients measured and ready.</li>
        <li>Grease your baking sheets <strong>HEAVILY.</strong></li>
        <li> Pour 1 cup of sand into each small baking sheet.</li>
        <li> Place all 3 small baking sheets on the beach for 1 hour, or until solid.</li>
        <li>Once solid, remove the baking sheets from the beach floor.</li>
        <li>Lift your solid sand layers out of the baking sheets, and place them on top of one another.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Garnish your sandwich with salt and pepper to taste, if you wish! Enjoy!</p>
