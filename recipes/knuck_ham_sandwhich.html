   <h3>The Backstory You Never Asked For</h3>
   <p> Growing up in the small town of Knuckles Illinois, I remember knuckle cousine being an essential part of our lifestyle. 
       We ate nothing else but various knuckle dishes, so there was no choice but to get extremely creative with recipes.
       As a community, there is a common known practice called <em>"Bulls Hitting",</em> (I know, weird name, and I have no idea where it comes from!)
       for those days when creativity and innovation is lacking. <br>
       <p><strong>Bulls Hitting</strong> is the tradition of inviting your friends and family over for a lavish knuckle dinner, and making it up as you go.
    Really. You write random food items on a sheet with whatever measurements you deem appropriate, and wing it! You either end up with a horrible dish
and priceless memories from pranking your guests, or you make a great dish.
With that being said, here is one dish my sister and I came up with through this great tradition. If I had one piece of advice for you going into this, it would be to <em>trust the process.</em> 
You will think this recipe is ridiculous, but I promise it will rock your socks off!</p><br>
